        <p>you'll be able to know more about me, you can see my socials, work portfolio, and my (very inconsistent) blogs where I ramble about projects or procrastination or absolute nothing.</p>

        <h1>New website?</h1>

            yes, to demonstrate more of my natural front-end skills instead of using a template made by someone. didn't really like the design
            of the original template either, looked very bland and i didn't know what colors to spice it up. also there were a lot that i really couldn't
            add onto the website as i feared i would mess up the page. so with a newfound website, this should allow me to be more creative and stupid
            with whatever i want to add.
